2. To start the business, the merchant will enter the present stock present in the inventory
    In case of gas cylinders it will be filled cylinders- Commercial, Filled Cylinders- Household, Empty cylinders - Commerical, Empty Cylinders- Household
3. Every time merchant receives new stock (against used stock in case of cylinders) in the inventory, he will make an entry in the inventory.
4. Every time Merchant sends used stock back he will make an entry in the inventory
5. Every day when merchant issues a bunch/batch of cylinders( commerical/ household) for delivery, he will make an entry in the inventory( number of filled cylinders sent, number of empty cylinders
received in exchange).
6. Every time merchant issues a new product ( new cylinder) to a new customer, he will make an entry in the inventory( he does not expect and exchanged empty cylinder in return).
7. When merchant receives payment against each cylinder he has delivered, he will make an entry in the payments account. He should mark each payment against which item/batch of items so as to track for how many cylinders delivered he has received that payment( and for how many cylinders payment is pending). The payment received should be against the invoice which mentions MRP, discount, GST etc. Do we need to manage invoices?
8. When merchant makes distribution expense( fuel, vehicle servicing,delivery boy commission) he will make an entry in the payments account.The delivery boy commission should be directly deducted from Cylinder MRP. So if a boy has  a commission on 10 rs per cylinder and MRP of cylinder is 1000 Rs then 10 rs should be dedcuted from 1000 Rs for each cylinder that the boy has delivered.
